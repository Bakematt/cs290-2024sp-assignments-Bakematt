# About Me Folder

This is up for your early assignments. It is set up to run a local
webserver that may be handy for testing out things like root-relative
links. To run the server, navigate a command prompt to the `aboutme`
folder, then do:

```bash
node ./serve.js
```

This will start a web server that you can visit by using the address
http://localhost:3000
