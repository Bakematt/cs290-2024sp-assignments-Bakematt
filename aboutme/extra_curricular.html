            <h3>Wood Working</h3>
            <p>
                Approximately six years ago, I discovered my passion for woodworking during the renovation of my master
                bathroom. Faced with the task of finding a suitable bathroom cabinet, I scoured countless stores and
                online. Determined to achieve find a solution, I decided to take matters into my own hands.
                As the project progressed, I realized that creating allowed me to
                infuse my personal touch into fine details, transforming a mere necessity into. Since that pivotal
                moment, woodworking has become one of my favorite creative outlets. I take a lot of inspiration from
                projects from Youtube. Below you will find a
                Couple of links to my favorite Youtube Channels.<br>Figure 1 below is one of the cabinet
                doors for a murphy bed I am working on. It is a walnut inlay with white oak border. The handle for the
                Door
                is white oak walnut finger joint.

            <h3>Tinkering/Electronics</h3>
            <p>
                I thoroughly enjoy integrating my passion for woodworking with my fascination for electronics. Recently,
                I embarked on a project that beautifully melded these interests: crafting Light Signs as gifts for my
                family and friends during the Christmas season. These Light Signs have quickly become highly coveted
                presents,
                appreciated for their unique blend of craftsmanship, creative designs.
            </p>
            <p>This endeavor provides me with the opportunity to engage and challenge myself across various domains
                that I
                deeply enjoy. From delving into 3D CAD modeling to mastering CNC machining techniques, from designing
                intricate electrical circuits to coding, each aspect of the project demands different skills, allowing
                me to
                stretch my abilities and expand my knowledge base.</p>
            <p>Moreover, this venture also pushes me out of my comfort zone by encouraging me to explore the realm of
                artistry, an area where I may not always feel entirely confident. Yet, through the process, I've found
                immense satisfaction in creating visually captivating pieces that combine aesthetics with functionality.

            <p> In Figure 2 and 3, you'll find the initial 3D model, capturing the essence of the design. Figure 4
                showcases the
                and creativityâ€”the final, illuminated masterpiece.</p>
